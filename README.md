# ReactNative_ASP.NetCore_FYP2024_TimmyApp
This repo houses an app built with React Native, ASP.NET Core WebAPI, Elastic Search, and Scrapy. React Native powers the front end, ASP.NET Core WebAPI handles backend services, Elastic Search provides robust search functionality, and Scrapy enables efficient web scraping.

## About this application
With the dramatic increase in the amount of information available, searching for desired products across multiple second-hand platforms consumes a significant amount of time for users. Therefore, this repo proposes an Android second-hand goods real-time price comparison system implemented based on Scrapy and ElasticSearch. This system offers subscription functionality, allowing users to subscribe to specified products and retrieve the latest real-time information from multiple platforms at regular intervals, thereby greatly reducing the time spent on searching for users. The focus of the research is on incorporating real-time price comparison and subscription functionality while simultaneously utilizing Scrapy and ElasticSearch.
